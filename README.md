# ventlog-0.2.0
Second version of Ventlog - More to come!

After creating the backbone of Ventlog, the best place to vent, we are now
in the process to make it more responsive to ease the access to our mobile
users.

The idea behind ventlog is to create a twitter-like platform allowing people to literally "put it all out there", anything that bugs is fair game. Be it someone they know personally, or perhaps they had an issue to raise politically. This is the place for it. (As of right now, users will be given the choice to be either annonymous, or not, when posting their online rants.)
