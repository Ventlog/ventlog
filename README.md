# ventlog-0.5.0
Fifth version of Ventlog - More to come!

-The whole project was redone using BootStrap to make a much cleaner UI/UX
-Addition of the load more button that pulls extra HTML code using AJAX

The idea behind ventlog is to create a twitter-like platform allowing people to literally "put it all out there", anything that bugs is fair game. Be it someone they know personally, or perhaps they had an issue to raise politically. This is the place for it. (As of right now, users will be given the choice to be either annonymous, or not, when posting their online rants.)

-J&D
